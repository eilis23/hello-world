My name is Eilis. You'll never figure out how to pronounce it, and if you do- you cheated. I have a billion children, love linguistics and learning languages and learning.... anything, really. I read way too much, but nearly as much as I did before the billion children. My blood is basically just tea, my children are homeschooled (really, all billion) and I'm newly obsessed with coding.
